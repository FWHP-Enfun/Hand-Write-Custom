# 花樂手寫定製 FWHP Hand Write Custom
模板是別人的，但是我用自己技術做字體，非機器轉，而是人工置入放成字體

The template is someone else's, but I use my own technology to make fonts, not machine-transferred, but manually placed into fonts

跟一些網站差別是，我會人工調整、人工合併字體

The fee is conditionally free, the copyright belongs to Huale (me) and the client, and must be authorized by SIL Open Font License 1.1

開源的繁體中文字體很少，自制的繁體中文字體也是，我寫字很醜，我想要找有意願的人

There are very few open source traditional Chinese fonts, and so are self-made traditional Chinese fonts. My handwriting is ugly. I want to find someone who is willing

盡量是有耐心的成年人，要寫4808以上的字，連常見的符號和英文數字也要

Try to be a patient adult, write more than 4808 characters, even common symbols and English numbers
