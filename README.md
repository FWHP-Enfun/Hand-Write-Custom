# 花樂手寫定製 FWHP Hand Write Custom

![](https://github.com/FWHP-Enfun/FWHP-Font/blob/main/FWHP%20Font.png)

模板是別人的，但是我用自己技術做字體，非機器轉，而是人工置入放成字體

The template is someone else's, but I use my own technology to make fonts, not machine-transferred, but manually placed into fonts

跟一些網站差別是，我會人工調整、人工合併字體，修改一些字體訊息

The difference from some websites is that I will manually adjust, manually merge fonts, and modify some font information

費用是有條件的免費，版權屬於花樂（我）和委託者，一定要SIL Open Font License 1.1授權

The fee is conditionally free, the copyright belongs to Huale (me) and the client, and must be authorized by SIL Open Font License 1.1

開源的繁體中文字體很少，自制的繁體中文字體也是，我寫字很醜，我想要找有意願的人

There are very few open source traditional Chinese fonts, and so are self-made traditional Chinese fonts. My handwriting is ugly. I want to find someone who is willing

盡量是有耐心的成年人，要寫4808以上的字，連常見的符號和英文數字也要

Try to be a patient adult, write more than 4808 characters, even common symbols and English numbers

# 字體審核 Font Review

我通常是看完整性為主，美觀是其次

I usually look at the integrity first, and the beauty is second

審核時間，我盡量找字體專家和工具鑑定，看是不是自創

During the review time, I try to find font experts and tools to identify whether it is self-made

通常成功原因是我有足夠時間做，字體很有風格

Usually the reason for success is that I have enough time to do it, the font is very stylish

失敗原因是很多種，我沒時間做、投稿作品完整性不高、沒理由的錯字、很多簡寫、懷疑使用侵權、很多字看不懂⋯⋯

There are many reasons for the failure, I don’t have time to do it, the integrity of the submitted work is not high, typos for no reason, many abbreviations, suspected use infringement, many words I can’t understand...

盡量別常用中國大陸寫法，我會退掉投稿，我有修改過簡體字體，加上我很喜歡綠色，日本寫法、舊寫法還算可以，我很希望有台灣味道的繁體字體

Try not to use the Chinese mainland writing method, I will return the submission, I have modified the simplified font, and I like green very much, the Japanese writing method, the old writing method is not bad, I really hope that the traditional Chinese font has a Taiwanese taste

我不會因為私人問題教任何人做字體，建議你自己摸索做字體

I will not teach anyone to make fonts because of personal problems, I suggest you to explore and make fonts by yourself

我不看寫字很醜的人，我喜歡追求夢想的人

I don't look at people with ugly handwriting, I like people who pursue their dreams

https://github.com/FWHP-Enfun/FWHP-Font/blob/main/Review.md

你可以到這裡看審核結果

You can go here to see the audit results

有時間，你可以看看

If you have time, you can take a look

# 後續處理 Subsequent Processing

投稿者如果想更新，有能力做字體，可以自己更新字體

If the contributor wants to update and has the ability to make fonts, he can update the fonts himself

沒能力做字體，可以投稿給我，建議更新100多字或大改進字體

If you don’t have the ability to make fonts, you can submit them to me. It is recommended to update more than 100 characters or greatly improve the font

大家想要要求更新，我會試著跟寫字作者聯絡

Everyone wants to ask for an update, I'll try to get in touch with the writer

如果寫字作者想要更新，我會給他一年時間更新

If the writer wants to update, I will give him a year to update

假如一年還是沒空沒更新，看我有沒有能力更新，如果沒有，SIL規定，你們可以更新成延伸新字體

If there is still no time to update for a year, see if I have the ability to update. If not, SIL stipulates that you can update to extend the new font

你就會知道為什麼喜歡SIL字體協議，看到喜歡的字缺少字很痛苦，補起來很開心

You will know why you like the SIL font protocol. It is painful to see missing characters in your favorite characters, but it is very happy to fill them up.
